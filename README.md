Create a simple Rails app to store anonymous citation/quotes, we do not require login or user accounts, just 2 views:

    view of all citations on index page (starting one)
    view to add single citation (just text input field plus a button to add).

Index page has a link to the page where you can add a new citation, 
after adding a citation user is redirected to starting page with citations listing. 
Just adding and displaying all citations is enough.

Host your app at Heroku so we can click it through. 
As a result, send us a link to the app and a link to the code repository.
